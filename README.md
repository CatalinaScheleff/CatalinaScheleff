### Hello 👋

I'm Catalina, a beginner full-stack developer from Chile.

As I dive into the world of web development, I'm dedicated to sharpening my skills. My passion is creating user-friendly web applications that deliver exceptional experiences.

I thrive in both collaborative team settings and when working independently. I'm excited about the possibilities that web development offers and am always eager to learn and grow. Currently, I'm on the lookout for a company that gives me the opportunity to grow as a full-stack developer.

Let's code and create something amazing together!
